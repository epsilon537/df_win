# Dragonfly Implementation for Windows
This is a Windows implementation of Mark Claypool's Dragonfly game engine: https://dragonfly.wpi.edu/
The goal is to come up with a CMM2 MMBasic version of this game engine, but I needed a by-the-book C++ version on PC to cross-check against.
The CMM2 version of this game engine will be uploaded as a separate repository.
